This project builds a machine learning model to predict airline ticket prices based on flight details such as airline, source, destination, departure and arrival times, total stops, and duration. After preprocessing the data and extracting features from date and time columns, a Random Forest Regressor was trained and tuned using RandomizedSearchCV. The final model achieved an RÂ² score of approximately 0.87 on the test set, indicating strong predictive performance. Key features influencing ticket prices included the number of stops, airline, and journey day. The project uses Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and seaborn for modeling and visualization.
